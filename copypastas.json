		"content":"y'all need to stop with this softcoding stuff:\n\nYou're generally referring to removing repeated code – and yes, this a good thing, normally. However, there are two issues with the attitude around this.\n\nFirst, not every situation mandates this kind of code structure. This is especially true of smaller games made by newer developers. We shouldn't avoid adding certain QOL features simply because in a \"properly\" coded game it isn't necessary. This second point doesn't apply specifically to this conversation but I see it coming up frequently so here goes: a lot of people take this way too far.\n\nI have seen so many plots where they do crazy things like spawn items on the ground to load information and whatnot. This is not good. Don't sacrifice code legibility and efficiency simply because they believe it makes coding experience easier. There is a delicate balance between well designed, easy to maintain, and efficient code. Softcoding is not always the way to achieve this balance. So please, just think about the systems you're designing and whether or not anything is actually improved.\n\ntl;dr  elitism through \"better practice\" / softcoding doesn't help, and often it isn't the right answer"

Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people do not exist. Whales live in the sea. There is a consensus on british people coming from Europe, but then we are left with a whole continent of possible locations. That's as good as nothing. What do they eat? Every country has at least one main dish. Even the US has their burgers. But these british people, what do they eat? Heard some people associating them with tea, but everyone knows that's an Asian thing. Shouldn't they come from Europe? One of these two points must be wrong them. To me, it looks too sketchy. What language do they speak? I challenge you, putting all my money and my ass on the line here, to find a supposed \"\"british\"\" person speaking their native language. Most of then just speak a broken ENGLISH. Yes, english. Really suspicious, huh? And I even tried to look deeper into it. Maybe british just SOUND like english, just like spanish could sound like portuguese for a non-speaker.

		"content":"Quick rant about DEADLY_JOHN: I asked him for dev on his game once, and I said it made my eyes hurt, and that I wanted to help make his game,  and this guy decided that I apparently had no value in my life, and that he \"Knew I was going to greif dev\" (Why would I want to be banned from DiamondFire?) Then later on said I exploited a glitch, (I didn't) after I consulted him on discord with a gif of talking ben, then he called me toxic for doing nothing besides sending some memes, and said I was a low life degenerate, and this guy had the nerve to join my friend's discord and spam everyone, and then blocked everyone and left the server, then continued to be toxic after writing a paragraph about how I am worth nothing, and here's some edited screenshots, I have the unedited screenshots if you want to see them. NOTE: I never got dev so what's with the top left corner? (Thanks for listening to my rant)",

		"content":"**About me**\n\n\tI am a Christian and computer hobbyist from Tennessee. I produce these videos as a personal hobby, and I greatly enjoy it. It allows me express my imagination and gives me a sense of progression. My favorite color is green, although blue and red are close seconds. \n\n\tI hold no denominational affiliation. In fact, I would say I have no formal religion, yet my God is the Lord Jesus Christ and my absolute is His word. I take God s word instead of the word of religious organizations, political parties, highly influential people, or the majority in general. I do not have a system of beliefs, but rather a living God who guides me into all truth. \n\n\tAfter the word, I am in favor of individualism. I am not against receiving criticism, as I am imperfect. If I made a mistake somewhere or you think I could improve on something, please let me know. But please be respectful in doing so.",

	"best-memes": {
		"content":"Do you think this is best-memes worthy? Someone getting a message that they were given tokens? Because most memes are some type of accident and none of them are funny. Like, maybe theres a funny meme once in a while but other than that, theres these trashy memes getting upvoted to best memes for the most lazy and unfunny stuff. At this point, Non oc memes are more funny."
